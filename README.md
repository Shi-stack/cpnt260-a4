***Information about Client:*** Created for our own startup. I know all experiments I am doing to develop my own site.. :D

***Goal:*** Created Hero Section with map navigation bar , news letter and inquires form. Make it reponsive, used media queries when using with mobile there will be no background image and font size will change.

Created multiple html and css for newsletter , inquires and main. So it will not create any confusion. Also in future I can use indiviual files. 

Css files are different for reset, font, main, newsletter and inquires.
